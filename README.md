# Red-vs-Blue

In the project, I played as two roles: pen tester and SOC analyst. As a pen tester, I attacked a vulnerable VM to obtain root access.  As an SOC analyst, I will review logs off the attack through Kibana and extract hard data and visualizations to create a report and mitigation strategies. An ELK stack configuration was used. It was done using Windows Azure Lab services. I used Kali Linux tools as the pen tester and Kibana dashboard with Filebeat and Metricbeat as the SOC analyst
